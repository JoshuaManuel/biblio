# Biblio

A desktop app to create bibliography citations.

Planned support for: APA, Chicago, and MLA citation styles.

## Installation

Download or clone the repo, then run "npm run electron:serve" in the directory to build and launch the program in developer mode.

I'll provide prebuilt binaries and make the Github Page later on in development as Biblio nears feature-completeness.

## Built With

* [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/)- Command line tool for scaffolding the initial Vue project
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - Dependency Management
* [vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder](https://github.com/nklayman/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder) - Scaffolding Electron in Biblio

## License

I haven't decided on which license to release this code under yet, but I'll update the project with it later.

## Bugs
+ When copying through the button, italics are interpreted literally as <i></i> tags
